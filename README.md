# Composite-method-responce-curves
The code plots response characteristics of a numerical method. By setting the parameters δ and γ to 0.3 and 2.78 respectively, we plot the curves for the spectral radius, percentage period elongations, and amplitude decays to study the dynamic behavior of the system.
